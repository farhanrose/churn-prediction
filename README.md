# üìä Churn Prediction Estimation
Churn Prediction Estimation is a project developed to estimate the churn rate of customers, combining machine learning techniques and interactive dashboard analytics to help businesses retain their customers. This project has two major parts:

## üß† Machine Learning Models for Churn Prediction
The first part focuses on building models to predict customer churn. Various machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification (SVC), and Neural Networks were applied to predict the likelihood of customer churn based on historical customer data. The detailed implementation of these models is provided in the ME781 Python Report. Key components include:

Data Preprocessing: Handling outliers, feature encoding (one-hot encoding), and balancing target features using SMOTE.
Modeling Techniques:
Logistic Regression for a baseline prediction model.
Support Vector Classification to achieve higher accuracy in churn prediction.
Neural Networks for complex pattern recognition.
Performance Metrics: Models were evaluated using Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1 Score.
Explore the full implementation for detailed model insights and data analysis.

# üìä PowerBI Dashboard for Churn Trends and Analysis
The second part involves the development of a PowerBI dashboard to visualize churn trends, customer segments, and key performance indicators (KPIs) that influence churn. This interactive dashboard provides actionable insights for decision-makers to understand the factors driving customer churn. Drawing inspiration from the Telecom Retention Business Understanding, the dashboard covers:

Churn Rate Trends: Visual representations of customer churn over time, segmented by various factors like customer plan, usage, and satisfaction.
Churn Drivers: Key factors such as pricing, customer service quality, and network reliability are highlighted as top reasons influencing customer churn.
Customer Segmentation: Different segments of customers based on loyalty and likelihood to churn, allowing targeted retention strategies.
The Telecom Retention PDF outlines the core business understanding and methodologies employed in the dashboard design.
